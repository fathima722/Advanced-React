# can think of it as an advancement to useState hook
# useState hook has a initial state but the useReducer has initial state and a reducer function(which is an action object)

-> useState can be used on less complex data (better to use data types such as strings, numbers or booleans)
-> useReducer hook can be used for complex data( better to use data types such as arrays or objects)
